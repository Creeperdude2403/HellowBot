HellowBot,
created by hellow123

Coded in the Scratch programming language, HellowBot is hellow123's second ever RLBot.

What does this bot do?

- Constantly chases the ball.
- Doesn't properly rotate, just ball chases.
- Tries its best to line up the ball with the goal to score.
- If the bot is at a weird angle from the ball to the goal, the bot might miss the ball completeley.
- Will either boost or front-flip dodge into the ball depending on if the bot has boost or not.

Please note: this bot is intended for 1v1 and will ignore teammates.
